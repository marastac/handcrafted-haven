# WDD430 – Handcrafted Haven

### 3) Meeting Summary (Week 03)

**Participants**

- Mario Alberto Astonitas Acuña (solo work this week)

**Challenge**

- Deciding whether to keep Tailwind CSS in the stack since the W03 guide marks it as optional. I chose to keep Tailwind from W02 to maintain consistency and speed up the UI work.

**Success**

- Implemented the first version of the landing page (hero + catalog preview) and confirmed the app runs locally. The project board was updated with 12 work items and 2 items moved into “In progress.”

**Insight**

- Breaking the UI into small, independent tasks (hero section, card component, product detail stub) made progress more predictable. Assigning an owner and a short target date to each card helped keep momentum.
